Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Claire, a full stack web developer with a keen interest in DevOps and AWS.

After seven years working within digital marketing I found myself becoming more and more curious with the coding and the development side of websites. 
Whilst working at Canada Learning Code in Toronto I was exposed to the exciting, thriving growth environment that comes with working within the tech industry.

Soon after I returned home with the motivation to seek out this new direction and poured everything I had into becoming a web developer. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few personal projects and sharping my skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Ruby & Terraform.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking for help with networking & finding a community within development to bounce ideas off and learn from.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about yoga, health & books!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: clairerennie88@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I want to travel overseas again!
